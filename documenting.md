## âœ… Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform â€” EC2 Bot Environment

In this phase, I automated the provisioning of an EC2 instance with a custom IAM role using Terraform. This sets the foundation for the AWS bot script that will run on the instance.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create Terraform Working Directory & Files

I created a new directory and added 4 files:

- `main.tf`
- `variables.tf`
- `terraform.tfvars`
- `outputs.tf`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Define AWS Resources in `main.tf`

This file sets the provider, EC2 instance, IAM role, and instance profile.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Declare Variables in `variables.tf`

I used three variables to make the config flexible:

- `aws_region`
- `ami_id`
- `key_name`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Populate Values in `terraform.tfvars`

This file holds actual values for the declared variables:

- `aws_region = "us-east-1"`
- `ami_id = "ami-020cba7c55df1f615"`
- `key_name = "coded key"`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Add Output in `outputs.tf`

I configured it to display the instance ID after provisioning:

- `output "instance_id" { value = aws_instance.bot3_ec2.id }`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Initialize, Plan, and Apply with Terraform

Hereâ€™s the order I followed in terminal:

- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply` â†’ (confirm with `yes` when prompted)

---

### âœ… Final Outcome for Phase 1

- EC2 instance with IAM role successfully created  
- All Terraform configs organized into 4 separate files  
- Verified instance and role in AWS Console

---
## âœ… Phase 2: AWS Bot Simulation â€” EC2 Script Execution and IAM Role Validation

In this phase, I connected to the EC2 instance provisioned in Phase 1 and executed a Python script that used the assigned IAM role credentials to interact with AWS services. The goal was to simulate how attackers might use EC2 instances with scoped permissions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: SSH into the EC2 Instance

Using the private key file associated with the key pair in Phase 1 (`coded-key.pem`), I connected to the instance:

```bash
chmod 400 coded-key.pem
ssh -i coded-key.pem ubuntu@44.204.16.40
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Check IAM Role from Within EC2

Once connected, I verified that the EC2 instance had an IAM role attached by using the Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv2):

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Write and Run the Python Bot Script

I created a simple Python script called `bot.py` that uses the `boto3` library to list all S3 buckets available to the EC2 instance:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')
response = s3.list_buckets()

print("âœ… Accessible S3 Buckets:")
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f" - {bucket['Name']}")
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Run the Script and View Output

I executed the script using Python 3:

```bash
python3 bot.py
```

The script successfully listed all accessible S3 buckets, confirming that the EC2 instance could interact with AWS services through its IAM role.

---

### âœ… Final Outcome for Phase 2

- Connected to EC2 using SSH
- Verified attached IAM role via metadata service
- Created and ran a Python bot script with Boto3
- Successfully retrieved a list of accessible S3 buckets


## ðŸš¨ Phase 3: AWS Real-Time S3 Breach Detection & Alerting System (CloudTrail + CloudWatch + SNS)

In this phase, I implemented a real-time alerting mechanism to detect suspicious S3 activities such as **PutObjectAcl**, **GetObject**, or **ListBucket** actions. These alerts are triggered by AWS **CloudTrail** logs and forwarded to **CloudWatch**, which then pushes notifications to **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**, ultimately sending me an **email alert**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Create Terraform Files for SNS Setup

To manage the SNS topic and email subscription, I created two new Terraform files:

- `sns.tf`: Defines the SNS topic resource and the email subscription

- `sns-variables.tf`: Declares variables for the SNS configuration, including the notification email address

This separation keeps the SNS configuration modular and easy to maintain.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Define SNS Topic and Email Subscription in `sns.tf`

Inside `sns.tf`, I defined the SNS topic resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "alerts_topic" {
  name = "s3-security-alerts"
}
```
Then, I created an SNS email subscription resource linked to the topic and the notification email variable:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "email_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.alerts_topic.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = var.notification_email
}
```
ðŸ“¸ `screenshots/phase3/01-create-sns-files.png`

<img width="1278" height="798" alt="VirtualBox_Kali Linux_19_07_2025_04_20_34" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62180bc1-7ad9-4563-9e6e-5548dde9536f" />

This setup ensures that any message published to the SNS topic triggers an email to the subscribed address.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Declare Email Variable in `sns-variables.tf`

I added this variable declaration for the notification email address:

```hcl
variable "notification_email" {
  description = "Email address to receive SNS alerts"
  type        = string
}
```
<img width="1278" height="798" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ede792f-a78f-483e-b075-deea1d3cdf51" />

This makes it easy to change the recipient without touching the core SNS config.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Populate Email Variable in `terraform.tfvars`

In the main variables file, I added my email:

```hcl
notification_email = "johnsonmatthewayobami@gmail.com"
```
<img width="1278" height="798" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f0bee1b-d979-483f-bd21-ea70f80862ea" />


After applying Terraform, AWS sends a confirmation email to this address to verify the subscription.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Apply Terraform to Provision SNS Resources

I ran the standard Terraform commands to deploy the SNS resources:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

I typed `yes` to confirm the apply. Terraform created the SNS topic and email subscription in my AWS account.
<img width="1278" height="798" alt="VirtualBox_Kali Linux_19_07_2025_04_31_08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd73ce66-0268-4666-a117-522a3f207268" />

After this, I checked my email and clicked the confirmation link to activate the subscription.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Update IAM Role to Allow SNS Publishing

To let the EC2 instance publish alerts, I updated the IAM role policy attached to the instance with SNS permissions.

I added this policy statement:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "sns:Publish",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:s3-security-alerts"
}
```
<img width="1278" height="798" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1329a967-b0ec-407b-ae7e-dd57a6e7b7f7" />

This lets the Python bot publish messages to the SNS topic securely.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Modify Python Bot to Send Alerts to SNS

In `bot.py`, I imported Boto3 SNS client and added a function to publish alert messages to the topic:

```python
import boto3

sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:s3-security-alerts'

def send_alert(message):
    response = sns_client.publish(
        TopicArn=topic_arn,
        Message=message,
        Subject='AWS S3 Security Alert'
    )
    print(f"Alert sent! Message ID: {response['MessageId']}")
```
<img width="1116" height="798" alt="VirtualBox_Kali Linux_19_07_2025_06_26_54" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d55b54c0-b27e-4ea1-84f9-e2784cc56293" />


Wherever the bot detects a public bucket or risky policy, it calls `send_alert()` with details.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Test Alert Workflow End-to-End

I ran the Python bot and simulated a detection of a public S3 bucket. Immediately, I received an email alert from AWS SNS with the alert message.

This confirmed the entire alerting pipeline works: detection â†’ SNS publish â†’ email notification.

---

### âœ… Final Outcome for Phase 3

- Terraform automated provisioning of SNS topic and email subscription

- Verified email subscription activation

- Updated IAM role to allow SNS publishing

- Enhanced Python bot to send real-time SNS alerts

- Tested and confirmed instant email notifications upon detection

- This phase sets the stage for future auto-remediation capabilities

---
---

## âœ… Key Learnings & Reflection

- Learned how to automate AWS infra with Terraform (IAM, EC2, SNS)
- Practiced EC2 instance role delegation with metadata inspection
- Used CloudTrail + SNS for real-time S3 breach detection
- Integrated Boto3 for secure AWS scripting inside EC2
- Gained confidence debugging permissions and service connectivity in AWS

---
---

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

This lab taught me a lot about AWS cloud securityâ€”especially how exposed metadata credentials and public S3 buckets can be abused by attackers. Building the infrastructure with Terraform, simulating the attack from an EC2 instance, and sending real-time alerts with Python and SNS gave me a hands-on understanding of how to detect and respond to these threats in real environments.
